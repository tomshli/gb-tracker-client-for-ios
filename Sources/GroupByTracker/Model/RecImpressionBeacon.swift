/// A recImpression (recommendation impression) event for the native app client type (as
/// opposed to other client types like web browsers) sent directly from the client (as
/// opposed to sent from a server serving the client). This event is used when a customer
/// sees a product recommendation on the web page or native app screen. If the product
/// recommendation comes from a GroupBy recommendation API, and an A/B test is being
/// conducted with the API, the experiments property should be included to enable measuring
/// effectiveness for the recommendation API configurations. Note that the only client
/// officially supported for sending GroupBy this data is the official GroupBy native app SDK
/// for the respective platform (Android, iOS, etc). A backwards incompatible change may be
/// made to a major version of this schema if the change would not be backwards incompatible
/// with respect to correct usage of the corresponding major version of the native app SDK.
